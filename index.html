        <h2>Domain Expantion</h2>
        <p>Gojo Satoru’s Domain Expansion - Unlimited Void, traps opponents inside an infinite space of knowledge. Within the domain, the mind is forced to perceive everything at once—sight, sound, thoughts, and sensations endlessly flowing without pause. This overwhelming flood paralyzes the target completely, leaving them conscious but unable to act. Even a fraction of a second inside Unlimited Void is enough to incapacitate ordinary humans. The domain perfectly reflects Gojo’s Limitless technique and Six Eyes, symbolizing absolute control over infinity. Visually, it is depicted as a serene yet terrifying void, where boundless information replaces reality itself. Unlimited Void stands as one of the most refined and deadly domain expansions in the world of jujutsu sorcery.
        Gojo’s Six Eyes drastically reduce cursed energy consumption, making his techniques almost cost-free.

He can keep Infinity active continuously, even while sleeping.

Unlimited Void delivers information without meaning, causing mental paralysis.

Gojo’s reactions are faster because his brain is constantly optimized by Six Eyes.

He intentionally limits himself to avoid accidentally killing allies.

The 0.2-second Domain Expansion was designed to protect civilians.

His blindfold actually helps control overwhelming visual data.

Gojo can instantly analyze enemy techniques upon sight.</p>

        <h2>King Of Curses</h2>
        <p>Ryomen Sukuna, known as the King of Curses, is the most feared and powerful cursed spirit in Jujutsu Kaisen. Originating from the golden age of jujutsu, Sukuna was once a human sorcerer whose overwhelming strength and cruelty transcended death. After his defeat, his power was sealed within twenty indestructible fingers, each containing immense cursed energy. Sukuna is ruthless, arrogant, and sadistic, viewing both humans and curses as inferior beings. His combat abilities are terrifying, combining unmatched physical strength, mastery over cursed techniques, and devastating domain expansion, Malevolent Shrine. Unlike most domains, it manifests without a barrier, allowing indiscriminate destruction over a wide area. Sukuna represents pure chaos and domination, standing as the ultimate embodiment of fear and absolute power in the world of curses.
        Sukuna was originally a human sorcerer, not a natural cursed spirit.

His four arms and two faces symbolize divine wrath and dominance.

Sukuna’s cursed energy control is extremely refined, not just overwhelming.

Malevolent Shrine lacks a barrier, breaking standard domain rules.

He can adjust slashing attacks (Cleave & Dismantle) based on enemy durability.

Sukuna understands cursed techniques instinctively, even when borrowed.

He heals effortlessly using advanced Reverse Cursed Technique.</p>

        <h2>The Sorcerer Killer</h2>
        <p>Toji Fushiguro, known as The Sorcerer Killer, is a legendary assassin feared even among elite jujutsu sorcerers. Born into the Zenin clan without cursed energy, Toji possesses a rare Heavenly Restriction, granting him superhuman physical strength, speed, and heightened senses. Free from cursed energy, he cannot be easily detected, making him a perfect predator of sorcerers.

        <h2>Reverse Curse Technique</h2>
        <p>Yuta Okkotsu is one of the strongest modern jujutsu sorcerers, renowned for his exceptional mastery of Reverse Cursed Technique. Unlike standard cursed energy, which is fueled by negative emotions, Reverse Cursed Technique is created by multiplying cursed energy against itself, producing positive energy capable of healing. Yuta can rapidly heal severe injuries, restore others, and sustain himself during prolonged battles. His immense cursed energy reserves allow him to use this technique far more efficiently than most sorcerers. Combined with his bond to Rika, Yuta’s control over Reverse Cursed Technique makes him both a devastating fighter and a powerful support ally. This rare ability highlights Yuta’s balanced strength—capable of destruction and restoration—marking him as a uniquely versatile and dangerous sorcerer.
        Yuta can output Reverse Cursed Technique, allowing him to heal others, not just himself.

His cursed energy reserves are so vast that even Gojo compares them to Sukuna’s level.

Rika acts as an external cursed energy storage, amplifying Yuta’s abilities.

Yuta can copy cursed techniques, but only under specific conditions.

Despite his strength, Yuta has a gentle personality, which contrasts his destructive potential.

He was considered a special-grade sorcerer before fully understanding his powers.</p>
